This is a sentence containing the inline equation $e^{i\pi} = -1$. Using
serverside rendering with KaTeX, displayed equations like 
$$
    \sum_{n\ge 1} 1/n^2 = \pi^2/6
$$
are also supported. For inline and displayed code listings, Highlightjs is used.
Inline displayed code like \icode{rust}{(0..n).collect()} is rendered with
syntax highlighting and so are entire displays
\begin{code}{haskell}
primes = filterPrime [2..] where
  filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]
\end{code}
Many other standard LaTeX things like (enumerated) lists are also supported. As
are standard blog features like generating lists of posts. Below is a postroll
in reverse chronological order.
